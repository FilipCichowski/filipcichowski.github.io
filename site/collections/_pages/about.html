      <p>From soldering my first circuit at age 10 to designing critical systems today, electronics has always been about solving real human problems. One of the first circuit I build was simple intercom connecting the living room & basement where my workshop was. Based on my expertise in power electronics & fluid dynamics I develop effective coolign solutions for modern datacenters.</p><blockquote><p>True innovation lies not in complexity, but solving real world problems effectively.</p></blockquote><p>My background in frontend development ensures graphical interfaces of my devices aren't just functional - they're frictionless. Lets turn your concept into a system that works as hard as you do. Questions? Let's discuss them together.</p>
