I am developing an antenna system for a stratospheric balloon for the Silesian Aerospace Technology scientific club. Currently, I am creating a miniature copy of the antenna deployment system based on the mechanism used in [ORCASat](https://youtu.be/KpfQcibo58A). The principle of operation of the mechanism is very simple: a measuring tape rolled several times into a loop unwinds spontaneously after opening the door and within a fraction of a second an antenna arm is created.

This uncommon use of measurement tape inspired me to create a portable J Pole antenna that fits in a backpack. I had a two-meter measuring tape at hand, so I decided to create an antenna for the 144MHz band.

## Implementation

To calculate the dimensions of the antenna, I used a calculator from [this website](https://m0ukd.com/calculators/slim-jim-and-j-pole-calculator/).
I chose a 0.93 velocity factor and after minimal tuning, I got the resonance for the desired frequency.

About 10 cm of tape measure remains on the roll, which allows you to tune the antenna by shortening or lengthening it.

I marked the calculated length of the 3/4 wave element with a line and from this point you should start tuning the antenna in the field.

The tape itself can be processed easily - it can be bent with miniature pliers, drilled with metal drills, and cut with scissors.

As supports for the tape, I used PVC spacers.

The antenna can be hung on the tree by measurement tape's rubber loop.

## Problems

The measuring tape is made of sheet steel, which is poorly soldered. Nevertheless, in my opinion, it is worth covering it with a thin layer of tin in the place where the cable terminal is screwed. This can be done with a high-power soldering iron using soldering acid.

The disadvantages include the low stiffness of the antenna (SWR can change with higher wind). In addition, the measuring tape is quite fragile - it can break after being bent several times.

## Ending word

Nevertheless, the antenna made in this way is an interesting experiment and I think it's worth doing for fun. Time will tell how durable this solution is.
