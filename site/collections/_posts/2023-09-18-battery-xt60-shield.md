I designed this shield for [LiFePo4 battery](https://allegro.pl/oferta/akumulator-enerblock-lifepo4-100ah-12v-lcd-13219403471) owned by SP9KJM radioamateur club. It features 6 XT60 connectors because we use them for Icom IC 7300 and other radios.

## Materials

In order to finish this holder you will need:

- 6x XT60BE-F connector with covers, I bought mine [here](https://pl.aliexpress.com/item/1005004111518826.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.21ef1c24sLuXJe&gatewayAdapt=glo2pol).
- 2x Spacer sleeve M8, you can buy it [here](https://www.tme.eu/pl/details/tfm-m8x15_dr2313/elementy-dystansowe-metalowe/dremec/2313x15/). I had to cut about 2-3mm of the threaded part.
- 2x M8 washer
- 2x M8 4mm^2 cable terminal, you can buy it [here](https://www.tme.eu/pl/details/bm013370/konektory-nieizolowane/bm-group/).
- 2x M8x10 hexagonal head screw
- 12x M3x15 countersunk head screw
- 12x M3 self-centering nuts
- 4mm^2 copper wire

You will need 3D print from [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/582245-xt60-shield-for-enerblock-lifepo4-100ah-battery). The model can't be printed on the Prusa printer - it's way too big!

## Contruction details

First, you need to mount 6 XT60 connectors with covers. Then, wire them using 4mm^2 copper wire. I'm not sure why, but I ordered XT60BE-F from two different Aliexpress sellers and they had different dimensions. Please double check .ipt files before printing! Next solder cable connectors and leave some extra wire in order to provide comfortable mounting.

Screw caps fit the screws very tightly, you can gently hit them with rubber hammer while mounting.
